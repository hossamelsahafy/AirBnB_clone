### Description

This project is a simple implementation of the backend for an Airbnb-like platform, specifically focused
on managing user accounts and listing properties. It consists of three main components: User Management, Property
on creating and managing user accounts, listing properties, booking rooms, etc. It consists of
a single file called `console.py` which contains all the necessary code to interact with the system
from the command line interface (CLI).
The CLI allows users to perform actions such as registering new users, viewing existing users,
listing available properties, making reservations, checking on the status of their reservation,
and logging out from the session.

### Usage

To use this program, you need Python installed in your machine along with pip. Once you have them
installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository into any directory of your choice.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt at that location.
3. Make sure you are inside the folder named "airbnb_clone" (the parent
folder of the "console.py" script). You can check this by typing `ls`
or `dir` in Windows Command Prompt. If you see the contents of the "console.
py" file then you're in the right place.
4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install
all dependencies needed for the application to run properly.
5. Run the application using the command `python console.py`.
6. Now you should be able to start interacting with the system through the CLI.</s>
